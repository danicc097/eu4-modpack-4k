 se_dominion_ideas: "Dominion Ideas"
 se_dominion_ideas_start: "Dominion Traditions"
 se_dominion_ideas_bonus: "Dominion Ambition"
 se_dominion_ideas_1: "More Precise Funding"
 se_dominion_ideas_1_desc: "Funding from our overlord would previously be squandered and divided up without end all over the place with little actual precision in the funding efforts. Now that we are our own dominion, we can direct these funds to actual building projects and infrastructure efforts in a much more concise manner."
 se_dominion_ideas_2: "Fair Self Rule"
 se_dominion_ideas_2_desc: "With ruling on our own in the manner comes ideas of laws and legislation that diverge from our overlord. Though we may not think exactly as our overlord does, we can put into action laws and legislation that are more suited to the local populace since we know them on a greater level than, well, our overlord knows them."
 se_dominion_ideas_3: "Frontiers of the Dominion"
 se_dominion_ideas_3_desc: "The various parts of our land are untamed and uncultivated, meaning anything from wild animals to brigands can hide out in them. Naturally we should be prepared with stalwart and strong defensive structures that emulate the strength of our overlord. From outposts to castles to military encampments, we will be needing them all."
 se_dominion_ideas_4: "Overlord Court Ties"
 se_dominion_ideas_4_desc: "The court of our land is inherently tied to the court of our overlord. From officials inside of it to materials used in its construction, every single person of our dominion knows that ideas and information are shared regularly between the two places and as such, officials are exchanged regularly too."
 se_dominion_ideas_5: "Points of Trade"
 se_dominion_ideas_5_desc: "How do we make our profits? Through taxation and trade of course. Taxation is an issue already sorted out thoroughly, but trade is something we must always be guarded by our people. Keeping it safe and ensuring that all caravans get through our land without injury is of vital importance to our well-being and our sustainability as a dominion."
 se_dominion_ideas_6: "Joint Protection Efforts"
 se_dominion_ideas_6_desc: "The safety of our land and the land of our overlord are of the utmost importance, thus contributing to the cause of protecting it is vital. Our military maintenance sector must be steadily improved alongside our military training sector so as to be ready for when war breaks out on our border or on our overlord's border."
 se_dominion_ideas_7: "Ready at any Time"
 se_dominion_ideas_7_desc: "Above all else, we must be on watch and ready for when hardship calls upon our people and our land. The military and the navy need to be in the best shape possible so that they can repel threats, ferry supplies, and relay information to and from places. All of this will help keep our lands not only prosperous, but also functional for the likes of ourselves and our overlord when needed."

 se_viking_settlement_ideas: "Viking Settlement Ideas"
 se_viking_settlement_ideas_start: "Viking Settlement Traditions"
 se_viking_settlement_ideas_bonus: "Viking Settlement Ambition"
 se_viking_settlement_the_hearing_of_locals: "From Lowly Lands"
 se_viking_settlement_the_hearing_of_locals_desc: "We came here knowing that life would be hard at first. The first generation to settle these lands and carve out a living for themselves are perhaps the strongest generation out of all that will come after, yet the first generation in these lowly lands are not pure savages who rely on brute force to get things done. They established a tradition of hearing out politics on a much more local level than in lands in Europe or elsewhere, and it is this tradition that we will keep close to us."
 se_viking_settlement_palisades_and_fortifications: "Palisades, Outposts, Garrisons!"
 se_viking_settlement_palisades_and_fortifications_desc: "Keeping ourselves safe in these new lands is of great importance, which is why establishing secure defensive lines and places where our people can scout from are necessary. Norse people are hardy enough that they can endure a lot of stress from the environment and enemy forces, but they are by no means invincible."
 se_viking_settlement_frontier_life_of_norsemen: "Frontier Work of the Colony"
 se_viking_settlement_frontier_life_of_norsemen_desc: "Life on the frontier is anything but relaxed during most times of the year. Sure there are days or maybe even a week or two where we can settle down and celebrate with a feast or ceremony, but most of the year we are sculpting this land in our own vision so that Norse people can live good a prosperous life. The work to make this happen helps train our soldiers and regular populace alike since both pitch in to this effort; who knows what dangers might fall upon our work out in the forests, hills, or along the shoreline."
 se_viking_settlement_for_norse_people_by_norse_people: "Well and Truly Norse"
 se_viking_settlement_for_norse_people_by_norse_people_desc: "We cannot call ourselves Norse if we do not respect our traditions and our ancestral beliefs. We must keep these beliefs and traditions alive as we carry on in this land of ours, whether it is through building up temples to provide a place of worship to the gods or establishing new sagas that can help pass on the beliefs and tales of old."
 se_viking_settlement_sea_trade_belongs_to_us: "Sea Routes and River Routes"
 se_viking_settlement_sea_trade_belongs_to_us_desc: "Trade has been an essential part of Norse life for ages, has it not? Coastal trading and moving along rivers, both have been crucial to how the Norse people have survived and thrived for this long. Establishing similar routes in these new lands and learning how the wind blows in the seasons will help facilitate a thriving trading economy for us."
 se_viking_settlement_the_making_of_harbors: "Prepare the Timber and Sails!"
 se_viking_settlement_the_making_of_harbors_desc: "To help establish our presence even more, what would a Norse settlement do? Why, build up its navy of course! Natural sailors, that is what we are, and it is sailing alongside shipbuilding that we will excel at within this very settlement! We are going to need large amounts of timber and cloth, but considering how well we've done so far, those two should not be hard to find."
 se_viking_settlement_an_emerging_norse_fleet: "New Voyages and New Journeys"
 se_viking_settlement_an_emerging_norse_fleet_desc: "When we have built up a strong enough navy and have established our presence in this land through new towns that can uphold Norse culture, what then shall we do? We shall do as our ancestors did and sail the great waters near to us and far from home! Perhaps we can even help our kin through the strength of our own ships and promote a healthy relationship with other Norse communities far from our own homes."
