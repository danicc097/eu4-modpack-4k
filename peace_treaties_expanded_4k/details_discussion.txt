[h1]Revolutionary Confederation[/h1]
[i]A Revolutionary Confederation is a mixture of a vassal and a personal union. If it borders its overlord or another Revolutionary Confederation of its overlord as well as another country that is not a Revolutionary Confederation and not the Revolutionary Target, it does not cost a diplomatic relation. It can only be established by the Revolution Target with independent monarchies and republics with their capital on the same continent. A Revolutionary Confederation can only be established by war with the Spread the Revolution or Crush the Revolution Casus Belli. It has a lower liberty desire than vassals and pays taxes to its overlord, but has the same ruler as its overlord. A Revolutionary Confederation gains half of the bonuses the Revolutionary Target gains. If it is a monarchy gives its overlord a bonus to legitimacy and the military skill of future rulers, or a bonus to republican tradition and influence of the Girondists faction if it is a republic, as well as reduction to aggressive expansion. If the overlord of a Revolutionary Confederation is not the Revolutionary Target anymore, the Revolutionary Confederation receives an additional +100% liberty desire.[/i]

[h1]Satrapy[/h1]
[i]A Satrapy is a mixture of a vassal and a colonial nation. It behaves like a vassal, but is less restricted in its diplomacy and has reduced liberty desire while paying tariffs like a colonial nation. It only joins its overlord's defensive wars, but the overlord can conscript troops from all Satrapies, which works similarly to the Daimyo's Sword Hunt. A Satrapy will automatically switch to a Republican Dictatorship. It can only be established by monarchies that are either Persia or a nation with the primary culture Persian, with a primary culture in the Iranian group that is also their dominant culture, with a primary culture not in the Iranian group but with any of them being the dominant culture as well as an accepted culture or with Persian as an accepted culture and at least 10 Persian provinces. If it has its capital on the Persia, Levant or India subcontinent and its overlord does as well, a Satrapy does not cost a diplomatic relation. A Satrapy gains a reduction to culture conversion cost and primary culture advisor cost and gives its overlord a bonus to possible advisors and minimum autonomy in territories.[/i]

[h1]Integrated Personal Union[/h1]

[h1]Iqta[/h1]
[i]An Iqta behaves similarly to a vassal, but is less restricted in its diplomacy, has reduced liberty desire, pays less money to its overlord and is locked to monarchy. It joins its overlord's wars and doesn't cost a diplomatic relation if it has its overlord's religion and at least 75% religious unity. It has to have its overlord's religion for them to prepare annexation, a prerequisite to annexing. This preparation increases its liberty desire and grants maluses that effectively halve the bonuses it gets from being an Iqta. It gains bonuses to tax income, mercenary cost and army maintenance cost and grants its overlord bonuses to missionary strength and missionary maintenance cost. Furthermore, an Iqta is influenced towards Mysticism if it follows its overlord's religion and towards Legalism if it doesn't. Enabling scutage will change the liberty desire of an Iqta by -10% as long as annexation has not been prepared. It can only be established by Muslim nations in other neighboring Muslim nations, and a country can have no more than 2 Iqtas. If an Iqta switches to another religion group, it must either switch to its overlord's religion or declare an independence war.

The overlord can ask a Papal Sanctuary to become a theocracy and to become a direct vassal. It can decide to become independent diplomatically, though only with enough liberty desire, if excommunicated, if the overlord is excommunicated or if the overlord doesn't fulfill the requirements of being overlord anymore. A Papal Sanctuary can only be established by the Catholic Papal State or owner of the Papal government or "Kingdom of God" modifier (if the Papal State doesn't exist) in independent, Catholic nations on the same continent that are neither excommunicated nor have the Statute in Restraint of Appeals.[/i]

It can be asked to join the HRE after 5 years, or to become a vassal after 10 years. It can ask to join the HRE after 3 years. It has low liberty desire, but gains additional liberty desire after 11, 15, 20, 25 and 30 years under its overlord. An Imperial Feud is a voluntary subject, which means it can become independent diplomatically. An Imperial Feud can only be established by the Holy Roman Emperor in non-HRE countries that border the HRE before the "Revoke the Privilegia" reform. If the emperor title gets passed to another country, an Imperial Feud can either become independent or will be passed from its old overlord to the new emperor.
