- Drag the files inside of the "Alternative Font.zip" to .../gfx/fonts in order to use the alternative font :P

- Drag the "map" folder within "Scaled Minimap...-.zip" to the directory where this very README file is located if you want the scaled minimap

- Any mod that adds or somehow changes GFX/.gui files (Aside from, say, flags packs and most map mods) will likely be incompatible as they need to be scaled too. However, apart from total conversion mods, this is thankfully a relatively simple process, so feel free to request any mods you want scaled and I'll try my best (99% of them should work with no issues, as long as they don't conflict with any other mod(s) you have installed!)



CREDITS:

goondo for their Scale_UI mod. Served as the chief inspiration for the creation of this mod, as well as being a great base for me start analyzing and learning from!

ArtemisFowl for their Artemis UI + Expanded Missions compatability mod!

Sulphur for their UI a la Sulfuris mod - Their work made it a lot easier to incorporate the Banners 5.0 mod which IMO adds an amazing visual touch to the game that I can't go back from!

The many creators of the awesome Expanded Mod Family of mods - Jay DoubleU, Stiopa866, LimonenZitrone, Melvasul, Zwei833 the High Pinger, LordVarangian, ComradDoge, Viking_Nephilim, Silver Knight of Anor Londo, Fly_Pepper, Vicryl, ChuKoNoob, Catoscar, UberEpicZach, Lumisentius, and anyone else that I might've missed xD!

Many of the wonderful people in the EU4 Mod Coop discord who helped with any modding questions I had as I learned!
