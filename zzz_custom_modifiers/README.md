## xorme ai + beyond typus + hard difficulty

- Must hugely reduce initial game blobbing, not enough AE. We consistently get:
  - France eats 90% of savoy.
  - Pope and company eat 90% of naples.
  - Morocco eats tlemcen

  We could reduce admin efficiency, increase war score cost until X year and
  have additional peace treaty options that are more lucrative than taking a
  province in early game.
