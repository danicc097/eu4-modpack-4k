- Delete or temporarily move somewhere else the "map" folder inside of this directory order to make it Ironman Mode compatible! Sadly, this means that your minimap will not be to scale thus it will be much smaller than the minimap's frame but this is a small price to pay, IMO!

- Any mod that adds or somehow changes GFX/.gui files (Aside from, say, flags packs and most map mods) will likely be incompatible as they need to be scaled too. However, apart from total conversion mods, this is thankfully a relatively simple process, so feel free to request any mods you want scaled and I'll try my best (99% of them should work with no issues, as long as they don't conflict with any other mod(s) you have installed!)

- If you don't like or want the loading screens I've included then you can remove them by simply deleting the .../gfx/loadingscreens folder

- Prefer the Stellaris Font? Open the aptly-named "Stellaris Font" folder, and as for the rest... you know what to do!

CREDITS:

goondo for their Scale_UI mod. Served as the chief inspiration for the creation of this mod, as well as being a great base for me start analyzing and learning from!

ArtemisFowl for their Artemis UI + Expanded Missions compatability mod!

Sulphur for their UI a la Sulfuris mod - Their work made it a lot easier to incorporate the Banners 5.0 mod which IMO adds an amazing visual touch to the game that I can't go back from!
